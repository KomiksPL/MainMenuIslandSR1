# Main Menu Island

Explore the Main Menu Island within the normal game environment, complete with gadget sites and spawners.

This mod transforms the very long bridge at the end of Dry Reef that takes you to the main entrance of the Moss Blanket. Previously, there was a part of the bridge that always seemed "incomplete" as it just ended. With this mod, that part now leads to a new area, providing an additional and interesting space to explore. Additionally, you can use this as a backdoor-shortcut to the Indigo Quarry.


## How to Access

Navigate to the very long bridge at the end of Dry Reef that leads to the main entrance of the Moss Blanket. The previously incomplete part of the bridge now serves as the entrance to the new area.
